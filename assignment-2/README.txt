*****FILE DESCRIPTIONS*****

ArraySortedList.java - My implementation of a priority queue. The add method sorts each entry when it is added using the compareTo function. Thus, any object using this priority queue must implement the comparable class.

PriorityQueueInterface.java - This is the interface that "ArraySortedList.java" implements.

QueueDriver.java - The driver provided by Dr. Novacky to test the priority queue implementation. Its output is identical to the provided "output.txt" file given with the assignment (not included in this zip file).
